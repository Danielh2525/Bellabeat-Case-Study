# Bellabeat Case Study - Analytics for Decision Making

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes smart-device usage data to identify behavioral patterns related to physical activity, sleep, and lifestyle habits. The goal is to translate raw user data into **actionable insights** that can inform Bellabeat’s marketing and product strategy.

This case study was completed as part of the **Google Data Analytics Capstone**, with a strong emphasis on structured analysis, clear reasoning, and decision-oriented outcomes.

## 📊 Data & Tools
- **Data:** Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data (daily activity, sleep, intensity, and usage logs)
- **Tools:**
  - Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  - Jupyter Notebook
- **Techniques:**
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Aggregation and segmentation
  - Comparative analysis

## 🔍 Analysis Process

### 1. Data Preparation
- Cleaned and standardized multiple datasets
- Handled missing values and inconsistent records
- Unified daily activity and sleep metrics

### 2. Exploratory Analysis
- Examined activity distributions and usage consistency
- Compared weekday vs. weekend behavior
- Analyzed relationships between activity intensity, sleep duration, and engagement

### 3. Pattern Identification
- Identified distinct usage behaviors across user segments
- Highlighted trends linking consistent activity with higher engagement
- Detected underutilized features and behavioral drop-offs

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Users with **consistent daily activity** showed higher overall engagement with the device ecosystem.
- Irregular usage patterns correlated with lower sleep tracking and reduced long-term retention.
- Weekend behavior differed significantly from weekdays, suggesting opportunities for targeted engagement strategies.
- Certain features were underused, indicating potential gaps in user awareness or product positioning.

---

## 🧭 Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following actions are suggested:
- Focus marketing campaigns on **habit reinforcement** rather than short-term activity spikes.
- Introduce targeted reminders or incentives during low-engagement periods (e.g., weekends).
- Emphasize sleep tracking features for users with inconsistent activity patterns.
- Segment users based on behavior consistency to personalize messaging and feature emphasis.

## ✅ Outcome
This project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow:
- Framing a business problem
- Structuring messy real-world data
- Extracting insights
- Translating findings into concrete, decision-supporting recommendations
